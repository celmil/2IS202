        <h2>The Port of Djupvik</h2>

        <p>The Port of Djupvik is located on the east coast of Gotland very close to the beautiful smaller island
        Lilla Karlsö. Adjacent to the the port is a small and charming fishing- village which, during summer,
        comes to life with a relaxed and welcoming buzz. <br />
        Close by and situated with a fantastic view over the port is Djupviks Hotel, with modern standard
        and with its own popular restaurant.
        Both the port and the fishing-village has a beautiful view of two popular bird-islands called “Lilla
        Karlsö” and “Stora Karlsö”. </p>
        <p>The coastline south of Djupvik, called “Ekstakusten” is incredibly beautiful and invites to nice
        scenery and views on foot, by bike or by car.
        North, and connected to the port is a small sandy beach which is well soothed for a nice swim.
        The distance from the port to Lilla Karlsö is about 2 nautical miles and it is about twice as long to
        Stora Karlsö (4nm). </p>
